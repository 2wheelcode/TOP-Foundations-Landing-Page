TOP Project: Foundations Landing Page

The Odin Project, this is my 
Foundations: Landing Page Project

    I am going to start by following TOP font and color guidelines, however I may change this as I go. This is a real business. It's mine. I built it from the ground up, and am very proud of it. After over 30 years of trucking, my health is dictating that it's time for a change, and it breaks my heart to have to leave this behind me. It's a hard life and a simple business, but it's mine...and I was damn good at it! I hope to become half the programmer I was as a specialized operator.

I have completed and received the following Cert's:
-HTML5 Foundations (Feb 2022)
-CSS3 Foundations (Feb 2022)
-JavaScript Foundations (Feb 2022)
-PHP7 Foundations (Mar 2022)
-Python3 Foundations (Mar 2022)

I struggled with CSS, but got through it. upon attempting to complete my first stagier project, I was struggling hard with the CSS, so I started looking for more resources to boost my skills and understanding, that's how I found TOP.

Notes to myself:
I keep making CSS and Flex layout too complicated
